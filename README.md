React Storefront is an open-source frontend e-commerce platform from the [Saleor](https://saleor.io) team.

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL with Apollo Client
- Tailwind CSS

  
## Motivation

**modern & fast**:
Project is focusing on best practices for e-commerce, like: SSR & ISR, image optimization.

**easily customizable**:
TailwindCSS can be easily extended and tweaked, or completely changed to your favorite css solution.

**works out-of-the-box**:
Pre configured tools for DX.

## Setup

Please note: this project use the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. To install it, run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Storefront can be now accessed at http://localhost:3001/.

## Development

All Apollo hooks are generated by [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) based on queries located at `./graphql` directory.

If you modify GraphQL files and would like to update the hooks, run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Script will start the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) in the watch mode, so changes in the queries will be automatically updated.

## Configuration

The `.env` file contains environment variables used by the application. You can override them by creating `.env.local` file.

## Debugging using VS Code

The repository contains ready to use VS Code debugger configuration (`.vscode/launch.json`).

Start server in debug mode

```bash
npm run debug
```

Add [breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints), and start debugging session in your editor.

## VS Code GraphQL Extension

GraphQL extension for VSCode adds syntax highlighting, validation, and language features like go to definition, hover information and autocompletion for graphql projects. This extension also works with queries annotated with gql tag.

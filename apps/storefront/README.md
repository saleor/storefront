This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-shop`](https://github.com/saleor/create-next-shop).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Debugging using VS Code

Repository contains ready to use VS Code debugger configuration (`.vscode/launch.json`).

Start server in debug mode

```bash
npm run debug
```

Add [breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints), and start debugging session in your editor.
